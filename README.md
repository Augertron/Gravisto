# Gravisto (The Graph Visualization Toolkit)

Gravisto (Graph Visualization Toolkit) is a program for visualizing and editing graphs.
Over the course of 15 years, many useful plugins have been developed to handle graphical information efficiently.
Unfortunately, this open source project had recently become homeless and needed a new home.
